# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-using-a-Shallow-Neural-Network
  This involves building and training a shallow neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model consists of a single hidden layer with 128 neurons and achieves a test accuracy of approximately 94.61%. The code includes data loading, model definition, training, evaluation, and prediction.
